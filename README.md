# Usage
Grab the [TriHdrPatcher.exe](bin/TriHdrPatcher.exe?raw=true).  
Drag and drop whatever file you might have into the executable.  
The tool will inform you if the file has a known SHA1, will fix some known dump errors and of course set a nice header for your loader.

Support for other OSes might follow in the future.
